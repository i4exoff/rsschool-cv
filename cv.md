### About me:

New to IT.
I worked for 12 years in the field of urban planning, 
using MapInfo, AutoCad and QGIS and other programs for working with cartographic materials. 
I work well in a team. 

I love to travel, it made me observant. 
I love music and singing, it made me creative. 

For a long time I was looking through the Business Lynch section on the Art. Lebedev Studio website with interest, 
and decided to try my hand at web development. 

I am sure that this profession will open up endless opportunities for professional development.
